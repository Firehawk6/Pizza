This is just a game im working on and ive just been wanting to learn how to create a game and how best with a flying pizza. :)

Im going to keep each version recorded here in GitHub so i can look back at my progress. So this one is 0.0.0.1 cant wait to get to 1.0.0.0 never know what could happen. ;)



Starting this im just going to put the bas of what i had in mind at this moment of working on the game. 
The basics is just what i wanted for v0.0.0.1 i feel like this brushed the surface of starting out that
it will be a good lookback image for me in the future. IDK call me weird. 
Who and What? So you are pilot piloting the Pizza (names of player and Pizza are still TBD. 
Time? i think i have an answer but still putting that together.
Location? Space duh.
Why? TBD



Im going on vacation soon so itll help me create the TBD information while i go see my family in Florida.
Dont expect anyone to read this but this will be a very fun project moving forward.


I completely understand that AI is frowned apon when it comes to game development. But for this game all art used in this project 
is NOT AI generated. I only use AI to help me with coding since im not very good at it and its teaching me how the code works together.
All the art i have purchased by me by artists in Freelancer websites. Their usernames and platform will be recorded and put into 
the credits when those are made but for now i will make another doc that has the lists for now on GitHub.
